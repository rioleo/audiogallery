============

This HTML5 audio and photo gallery is based about Jay Salvat's code demo:

It makes several improvements upon it, including:

* Adding one's own audio instead of standard traffic sounds
* Not starting the slideshow automatically
* Fixing the pointer CSS
* Allowing some rudimentary keyboard controls
* Hiding the navigator after the first page
